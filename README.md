This app works like a task manager. Using the previously developed backend, the app allows creating tasks, as well as editing and deleting them. The app also supports user authentication.

### [InstaClone](https://github.com/BordignonMD/Curso-React-Native/tree/master/instaclone)

This app is a clone of the Instagram app. It is possible to post photos, in addition to commenting on other publications. The application uses firebase to authenticate users and store posts.

## Difficulties and challenges

The main difficulties in carrying out the course were the version of some React Native libraries and resources, such as React-Navigation, which was deprecated.
For these libraries, consultations and tests were necessary to correct the application using alternative libraries.
